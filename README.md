My first leaflet map

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to create a simple interactive map using Leaflet.js. The map is centered on Svalbard Island and includes various features such as markers, a custom basemap, and different shapes (line, triangle, hexagon, and circle).

## Features
1. **Custom Basemap**: The map uses the Esri World Imagery basemap.
2. **Marker**: A marker is placed at the center of Svalbard Island with a popup message.
3. **Line**: A red line is drawn on the map.
4. **Triangle**: A blue triangle is drawn on the map.
5. **Hexagon**: A green hexagon is drawn on the map.
6. **Circle**: A yellow circle with a red fill is drawn on the map.

## Code Overview
### HTML Structure
The `index.html` file includes the necessary Leaflet.js CSS and JavaScript files and sets up a `div` element with the id `map` to hold the map.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript code initializes the map, sets the view to Svalbard Island, and adds the Esri World Imagery basemap. It also adds the following features to the map:
- A marker with a popup message.
- A red line.
- A blue triangle.
- A green hexagon.
- A yellow circle with a red fill.
